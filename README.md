# ECE545-Final-Project---DynamicFetchBot
DynamicFetchBot is a robot on four wheels that can trace the incoming of an object and predict its landing trajectory within a pre-defined region, and intercept the ball at the landing site. The bot has two main components: a Computer Vision Pipeline for object detection and tracking, along with a Robotics Pipeline for movement and dynamic control.
